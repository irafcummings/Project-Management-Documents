## Project Specifics

### Details

_This section is used to define the high-level parameters of the work. Essentially, it is laying out what it is, per the client's request. This doesn't mean that it has to be as concrete as a physical or digital product. It could include an exploratory phase._

_It's generally good practice to outline the steps involved in the process. This will vary widely from business to business and client to client, but it can be extremely helpful for clients to know what the process looks like. It also helps you, as a practitioner, to create value for the work that you do by defining a system for doing the work._

### Deliverables

_Once this project is completed, what will it produce? Sometimes this is a very tangible product, sometimes it's a website or digital artifact. Sometimes it will merely define the next phase. Regardless of the outcome, having agreement about what it is with a client will avoid miscommunications as the project evolves._

### Approximate Schedule

_Following initial discussions with the client, you should have a rough idea of what schedule they would like. This may or may not be realistic. You should lay out a rough outline of a relative timeline. A general suggestion would be to define the steps of the project and how long they take instead of laying out a schedule with exact dates. Putting dates on the calendar at this stage can be time consuming, and the start date of the project is still far from concrete._

## Cost
### Project Fees
_Here is the area where you outline the cost for your services. Some people bill hourly, some by the project, some have retainers. Whatever fee model you use, explain and define it here. Sometimes you'll want to include a range here, if the project is still being defined. If you are offering any sort of discount to the client, this is a good place to include that._

### Expenses
_It's better to be up front with possible expenses, so that the client is aware of what they are getting into. Being clear about what costs they can expect increases transparency, and will engender trust between all parties._

# Total Cost: COST
_Total up fees, discounts, and expenses. Include that number here, with any qualifiers that need stating._

This quote is valid for [NUMBER] days after its issue by [OWNER]. _Generally good practice to include a line to this effect, should the project get shelved, only for the client to return a year later when your expenses have increased._
