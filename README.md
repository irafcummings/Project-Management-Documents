# Project-Management-Documents
A collection of common documents for managing design and development projects for small studios and freelancers. The intention is to create a framework (in the conceptual sense) for project documents to make sure that the right questions are asked at each step of the process, and the right information is gathered from the client.

For the sake of organization, documents are organized by the typical chronological phases of a project. Of course, no project is typical, so no doubt some documents will be used out of order.
